Line for the school registrar using a queue

Simulation.h Student.h MyWindows.h ListInterface.h main.cpp, MyWindows.h GenQueue.h, DoublyLinkedList.h, Makefile

Worked with Devin K

NA

make all 
./assignment5.exe input.txt

//window values 3 and 4 dont give seg faults but other vlues may give seg faults
//some values might throw empty queue exceptions
//make file also doesnt always work so maybe try g++ *.cpp then ./a.out input.txt the make file may work though
